# NEW B-Spline
Application that allows plotting and interaction with B-Splines of any degree using De Boor's algorithm. 
for this bspline I have implemented my own De Boor's algorithm with dictionaries to speed up the computational process by not using recursion 

## Sources:
* B-spline: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline
* Algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Boor%27s_algorithm

# Code:
    The for the implemetation of spline can be found  under
    > >CurvesEnv/lib/python3.5/MyPackages
    But I have provided the code under this directory as well.
